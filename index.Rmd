Thank you very much for being here today. Prediction, far from being a mystic power, is something we do on our daily lives.

For example, if you play frisbee, you need to predict the position of the frisbee in order to be able to catch it. When you see a bear you predict what might happen if you stay close and you start running away.

# Linguistic prediction

--
## **Pre-activation** of stored linguistic information

--

## Important for: **sentence comprehension**

--

## Listeners are not passive, they **generate expectations**

--

## Anticipation is used during **simultaneous interpreting**

???

Language is no exception to these anticipatory mechanisms. During this presentation, prediction or anticipation are synonyms, meaning: pre-activation of stored linguistic information before it is actually said.

# Goal

## Investigate whether

- ### prosodic information can generate expectations about the end of a word

--

- ### L2 learners can use prediction while processing their L2


--

- ### experience with complex processing (interpreting) can train anticipatory processing

# Semantic <br/> anticipation <br/> 

???

I will start by reviewing the literature on semantic anticipation, both during native and second language processing.

---

# Semantic Anticipation


## L1 Studies

- Natives use contextual information to predict (DeLong et al., 2005)
    - The day was breezy so the boy went outside to fly a kite / an airplane
    - But not always (Nieuwland et al., 2018) 
    
- Also information contained in the verb
    - E.g. The boy will eat the cake (Altmann & Kamide, 1999)


---

# Semantic Anticipation 


## L2 Studies

- L2ers also anticipate based on contextual information
    - El pirata tenía el mapa secreto, pero nunca encontró el tesoro/la gruta que buscaba (Foucart et al., 2014)
    - But not always (Martin et al., 2013) (they might be too slow)
    
- L2ers anticipate semantic info based on the verb to the same extent as natives (Dijkgraaf et al., 2016)
    - Both in their L1 and L2
    - But they are slightly slower (L1 and L2)

# Prosodic <br/> anticipation <br/>

# Suprasegmental Information - Lexical Stress

- Relative prominece of a syllable in a word.
- Contrastive in English and Spanish, but used differently


--

.pull-left[

### English
- Stress-timed 
- English natives use suprasegmental information for lexical access, but segmental information has a stronger role in lexical activation (Cooper et al., 2002).
 
]

--

.pull-right[

### Spanish
- Syllable-timed 
- Most words are paroxytone (PApa), oxytone stress (paPÁ) is less common
- Suprasegmental is crucial for lexical access (Soto-Faraco et al., 2001)
- English L2 learners of Spanish: issues with stress production and perception (Face, 2006). 


]

???

Constrative means that it changes meaning: PApa vs. paPÁ, CONtent vs. conTENT


---

# Segmental Information - Syllabic Structure

## CV - papa

## CVC - carne

## Works similarly in both languages

  - ### CV = more frequent
  - ### CVC = less frequent, hence, less lexcial competitors


---

# Prosodic Cues for prediction


## L1

- Contrastive intonation guides the initial syntactic analysis (for Japanese Nakamura et al., 2012)

- English vowel duration preactivates upcoming morphology (active/pasive verbs) (Rehrig, 2017)

- Swedish word-tones preactive upcoming morhphology (present/past, singular/plural) (Roll, 2015)


---
# Prosodic Cues for prediction

## L2

- Advanced L2ers cannot use vowel duration for prediction (Rehrig, 2017)

- Advanced L2ers can use word tones for prediction (Schremm et al., 2016)

- Beginning L2ers cannot use word tones (Gosselke Berthelse et al, 2018)

- Morphological prediction based on word-tones can be explicitly trained (at beginner level) (Schremm et al., 2017)

# Interpreters

Now I will continue explaining why have chosen this particular bilingual population (besides because of personal reasons). This is me doing an interpreting internship at the Human Rights Council at the UN in Geneva.

# Interpreters & Processing

- Very complex task, Efforts Model (Gile, 2009)
    - Listening, analysis, production, and memory

- Better at: semantic and lexical access, reading speed and comprehension, resistance to articulatory suppression, cognitive flexibility, working memory, phonological short-term memory (Bajo et al, 2000).

- Better than natives at error detection in their L2 (Yudes et al. 2013)

- They adapt the parsing preference for ambiguous sentences depending on the task (reading or interpreting) (Togato et al. 2015)


???

Togato: When reading ambiguous sentences that could be interpreted with both low attachment (preferred by English natives) and high attachment (preferred by Spanish natives), they adapt to the preference according to the task they are doing.

# Interpreters & Anticipation

## Anticipation...

.pull-left[
- is taught in simultaneous interpreting courses (Li, 2015)

- releases cognitive load (Seeber, 2011)

- has been studied in language pairs with asymmetrical syntactic structures (SVO/SOV) (Van Besien, 1999)

- used often and succesfully (Liontou, 2012)

- possible thanks to contextual knowledge and syntactic knowledge (Moser-Mercer, 1978)

]
--

.pull-right[

- But we still don't know
  - Other cues?
  - Other referents?
  - Interpreting practice enhances anticipation?
]

???

Interpreters are also interesting for this topic because they use anticipation while performing simultaneous interpreting.

## Can prosodic cues only guide morphological prediction?
## Or does the same mechanism apply to any lexical item?

--

## Is proficiency the only factor that modulates L2 prediction? 
## Or does additional experience anticipating impact L2 prediction?

# The study

# Research questions

### 1. Do Spanish monolinguals, non-interpreter bilinguals and interpreters use lexical stress and syllabic structure to anticipate lexical (non-morphological) information?

### 2. Does interpreting experience train anticipatory processing?

# Eye-tracking: sample trial

???
After calibration, the participant saw a fixation cross for 250ms, followed by 1000ms of the two possible words (as it is standard in visual world paradigm experiments), and then they listened to a sentence containing one of the two words.

# Eye-tracking task

- 16 pairs of sentences

# Eye-tracking task

- ### Los investigadores apuntan que papa es una planta comestible 

  - (Researchers indicate that potato is an edible plant)
  
- ### Los investigadores apuntan que papá es quien ejerce de padre 
  - (Researches indicate that dad is who acts as a father) 

---

# Statistical Analyses

### Growth Curve Analysis 
  
  - Determine whether participants can anticipate
  - Evaluate group differences

### Fixed effects:

  - group
  - lexical stress
  - syllable structure 

### Random effects:

  - by-subject random effects (random slope: syllable structure and lexical stress)
  - by-item random effects on all time terms

# Discussion

---

### 1. Do Spanish monolinguals, non-interpreter bilinguals and interpreters use lexical stress and syllabic structure to anticipate lexical (non-morphological) information?

- Monolinguals and interpreters anticipate above chance in all conditions

- Monolinguals anticipate at a higher rate

- Non-interpreters are only able to anticipate when both restrictive cue types (oxytone + coda) are present

---

### 2. Does interpreting experience train anticipatory processing?

- NIN predicted significantly less

- Syllable structure × Lexical stress × Group NIN, Syllable structure × Lexical stress × Group IN For IN and NIN, 





---

# Conclusions

1. Our findings support models advocating that it is possible to train anticipatory processing (Schremm, et al., 2017).

2. 

2. prediction strategies in the bilingual mind can be enhanced through implicit (i.e. interpreting) training. 




---

# Limitations and future studies

- Other reasons why interpreters are better:
    - increased weekly contact with the L2, 
    - stronger resistance to articulatory suppression

- Future studies:
    - Non-linguistic prediction task (movement, rhythmic)

I wanted to end with a quote that I believe captures why anticipation is important, although probably not necessary for comprehension.
