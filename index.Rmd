Thank you very much for being here today. Prediction, far from being a complicated cognitive construct or a mystic power, is very much present in our daily lives. 
For example, when doing an eye-tracking experiment on Cristiano Ronaldo to try to figure out why he's better than other soccer players, they found out that he would look at his rival feet instead of the ball, in order to predict his movements and to be one step ahead of him.

# Linguistic prediction

--
## **Pre-activation** of stored linguistic information before it is available in the input.

--

## Important to understand: 
--

- ### which cues speakers exploit

- ### why processing is so fast and effective

- ### why L1 and L2 processing are different

# Prosodic Cues for prediction - L1

### Intonation

- Contrastive intonation guides the initial syntactic analysis (for Japanese Nakamura et al., 2012)

### Vowel duration
- English vowel duration preactivates upcoming morphology (active/pasive verbs) (Rehrig, 2017)

### Word tones
- Swedish word-tones preactive upcoming morhphology (present/past, singular/plural) (Roll, 2015)


---
# Prosodic Cues for prediction - L2

### Vowel duration

- Advanced L2ers cannot use vowel duration for prediction (Rehrig, 2017)

### Word tones

- Advanced L2ers can use word tones for prediction (Schremm et al., 2016)

- Beginning L2ers cannot use word tones (Gosselke Berthelse et al, 2018)

- Morphological prediction based on word-tones can be explicitly trained (at beginner level) (Schremm et al., 2017)

# Suprasegmentals - Lexical Stress

- Relative prominece of a syllable in a word.
- Contrastive in English and Spanish, but used differently


--

.pull-left[

### English
- Stress-timed 
- English natives use suprasegmental information for lexical access, but segmental information has a stronger role in lexical activation (Cooper et al., 2002).
 
]

--

.pull-right[

### Spanish
- Syllable-timed 
- Most words are paroxytone (PApa), oxytone stress (paPÁ) is less common
- Suprasegmental is crucial for lexical access (Soto-Faraco et al., 2001)
- English L2 learners of Spanish: issues with stress production and perception (Face, 2006). 


]

???

Constrative means that it changes meaning: PApa vs. paPÁ, CONtent vs. conTENT


---

# Segmentals - Syllabic Structure

## CV - papa _(dad)_

## CVC - carne _(meat)_

## Works similarly in both English and Spansih

  - ### CV = more frequent
  - ### CVC = less frequent, hence, less lexcial competitors

Now I will continue explaining why have chosen this particular bilingual population (besides because of personal reasons). This is me doing an interpreting internship at the Human Rights Council at the UN in Geneva.

# Interpreters & Processing

- Very complex task, Efforts Model (Gile, 2009)
    - Listening, analysis, production, and memory

- Better at: semantic and lexical access, reading speed and comprehension, resistance to articulatory suppression, cognitive flexibility, working memory, phonological short-term memory (Bajo et al., 2000).

- Better than natives at error detection in their L2 (Yudes et al., 2013)

- They adapt the parsing preference for ambiguous sentences depending on the task (reading or interpreting) (Togato et al., 2015)

## QUESTIONS RELATED TO THE CUES AND THE TYPE OF INFORMATION ANTICIPATED

--

## **Proficiency** is an important factor for L2 prediction 
## Does additional **experience anticipating** impact L2 prediction?

# Participants

# Experiment 1: morphology

- Monolinguals (n = 32)
- Non-interpreter bilinguals (n = 26)
- Interpreter bilinguals (n = 24)
- Learner groups: comparable L2 proficiency
- All groups: comparable WM

## Experiment 2: word ending

- Monolinguals (n = 32)
- Non-interpreter bilinguals (n = 26)
- Interpreter bilinguals (n = 24)
- Learner groups: comparable L2 proficiency
- All groups: comparable WM

# Materials

.pull-right[

- Background questionnaire (5 min)
- Proficiency test (DELE) (15 min)
- Eye-tracking task (20 min)
- Working Memory task (10 min)
- Phonological Short Term Memory task (10 min)

# Eye-tracking: sample trial

???
After calibration, the participant saw a fixation cross for 250ms, followed by 1000ms of the two possible words (as it is standard in visual world paradigm experiments), and then they listened to a sentence containing one of the two words.


---

# Eye-tracking task

- ### Los investigadores apuntan que **papa** es una planta comestible 

  - (Researchers indicate that potato is an edible plant)
  
- ### Los investigadores apuntan que **papá** es quien ejerce de padre 
  - (Researches indicate that dad is who acts as a father)

# Statistical Analyses

### Growth Curve Analysis 
  
  - Determine whether participants can anticipate
  - Evaluate group differences

### Fixed effects:

  - group
  - lexical stress
  - syllable structure 

### Random effects:

  - subject (random slope: syllable structure and lexical stress)
  - item

# Results

???

We're going to see the same date from 2 different perspectives
1. Comparing syllabic structure curves for every group
2. Comparing group curves for items with and without coda

The model intercept estimates the log odds of participants fixating on the target, averaging over the time course, lexical stress and syllable structure

# Conclusions

1. Our findings support models advocating that it is possible to train anticipatory processing (Schremm, et al., 2017), also with long-term training.

2. Prediction strategies in the bilingual mind can be enhanced through implicit (i.e. interpreting) training. 

3. Prediction strategies are qualitatively similar in the L1 and L2, but quantitatively different.

4. Word-level prediction mechanisms are similar in both morphological and non-morphological word-endings.

5. Less frequent prosodic patterns (oxytone stress, CVC syllabic structure) reduce the number of possible lexical competitors and facilitate prediction.

# Limitations and future studies

- Other reasons why interpreters are better:
    - increased weekly contact with the L2, 
    - stronger resistance to articulatory suppression

- Future studies:
    - Non-linguistic prediction task (movement, rhythmic)
