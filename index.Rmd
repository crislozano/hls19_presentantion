Thank you very much for being here today. 
By reading the title, predicting the end, you might be thinking about some sort of apocalyptic account. 
But prediction, far from being a complicated cognitive construct or a mystic power, is very much present in our daily lives.

They found out that he looks at his rival feet instead of the ball because this allows him to predict his movements and to be one step ahead of him. So prediction makes him a more efficent player.

- ### which cues speakers exploit

- ### why processing is so fast and effective

- ### why L1 and L2 processing are different

# Goal



- ## Investigate prosodic cues for prediction in L1 and L2 Spanish

- ## Role of anticipatory experience

???

Generally speaking, we want to investigate the role of prediction based on prosodic cues in L1 and L2 Spanish

and also the role of anticipatory experience as a modulating factor of prediction ability in the L2

Focusing on native speakers, research has shown that, when the context is non-predictive, there are other cues that speakers use to predict upcoming information. For example, the gender instantiated in the determinter, allows the speaker to predict the object that will be mentioned (when only one of the displayed objects is femenine.) This is study with done with children

Something similar happens with case. When native German speakers hear the case in the article, they look to what's coming. In SVO, they look to the object, in OVS, they look to the subject

### Predictive context 

- Constraining sentences <sup>1</sup>

e.g. "The day was breezy so the boy went outside to fly a/an kite/airplane"

- Semantic information from the verb <sup>2</sup>

e.g. "The boy will eat/move the cake"


]

.footnote[
1. DeLong et al. 2005
2. Atlmann & Kamide, 1999
]

???

Other researchers have focused on what happens when the context of the sentence is constraining. For example, when hearing the sentence "the day was breezy....", native speakers show a surprisal effect in the case of the less freqent noun (airplane), but importantly, this effect is shown already at the article. A group of labs failed to replicate this effect, but we can discuss at the end if your interested.

Other examples of predictive context would be sentences where the semantic information in the verb helps to predict what comes next. For instance, when presented with this image and hears the sentence They boy will eat the cake, the participant is already looking at the cake right after hearing the verb eat.

What happens with L2 learners?

- Japanese contrastive intonation preactivates the initial syntactic analysis in L1


### Lexical stress

- Spanish natives use lexical stress to predict morphology
- Beginner L2ers cannot use lexical stress to predict morphology
- Advanced L2ers use lexical stress to predict morphology, only under certain conditions

# Prosodic Cues for Prediction - L1 & L2

### Vowel duration
- English vowel duration preactivates upcoming morphology (active/pasive verbs) in L1
- but not in advanced L2 learners


### Word tones

- Swedish word-tones preactive upcoming morhphology (present/past, singular/plural)
- Advanced L2ers can use word tones for prediction
- Beginning L2ers cannot use word tones
- Morphological prediction based on word-tones can be explicitly trained (beginner level)

There are still some questions that we haven't answered

---
class: inverse


## Can **lexical stress** and **syllabic structure** be used to predict morphological endings in L1 and L2 Spanish?
## What about non-morphological word endings?
### Does prediction only happen when we can separate the word in two components?

## Proficiency is an important factor for L2 prediction, but...
## Does additional **experience making predictions** impact L2 prediction?

After calibration, the participant saw a fixation cross for 250ms, followed by 1000ms of the two possible words (as it is standard in visual world paradigm experiments), and then they listened to a sentence containing one of the two words.

# Statistical Analyses

### Growth Curve Analysis 
  
  - Determine whether participants can anticipate
  - Evaluate group differences

### Fixed effects:

  - group
  - lexical stress
  - syllable structure 

### Random effects:

  - subject (random slope: syllable structure and lexical stress)
  - item

???

We analyzed the time window spanning from 200ms before the target syllabe offset, until 600ms after. 

The GCA is a model that fits that data to its functional form. We included the linear, quadratic and cubic time terms.

.tiny[Model estimates for probability of target fixations ± SE at 200 ms after the target syllable offset]
]

???

In this graph we are looking at the probability of fixations towards the target averaging across all conditions 200ms after the offset of the target syllable (it takes 200ms for the eye to move after having heard a particular stimulus). So just one specific time point (the intercept of our model). On the Y axis we have probability of fixations, the thick white line indicate chance. On the x axis we have the 3 groups. The blue points are paroxytone conditions (firma and papa), red oxytones (firmó and papá). Circles are targets without a coda, triangles are targets with a coda. 

In the morphological ending experiment, we see that monolinguals can predict the ending above chance for all conditions, although CV paroxytones seem to yield a lower rate of fixations. The non-interpreters and interpreters show a similar pattern, they seem to predict at a lower rate, but they don't do it above chance for CV parox.

In the non-morphological ending experiment. Monolinguals show almost the same pattern. But we see differences between interpreters and non-interpreters. The non-interpreters can only anticipate above chance in the CVC oxytone conditions, whereas interpreters predict above chance for all conditions, the seem to do so at a lower rate with the CV condition and the paroxytone condition.

In the previous graph we were seeing what happens at the intercept (point at it in the graph). In this graph we're seeing the model estimates for the time window from 200ms before the offset of the target syllable, until 600ms after.

On the top panes we have conditions without the coda, for parox and oxy, bottom conditions with coda. We see that overall, monolinguals anticipate earlier (the curve crosses change eairlier in the time course) and at a higher rate (by the offset of the target syllable, the curve is higher). 

In the case of Experiment 1, we see that interpreters and non-interpreters behave similarly, interpreters seem to anticipate later in the time course, they are doing it faster because the reach the same rate of anticipation by the offset of the target syllable.

Moving to Experiment 2, we see differences between the interpreters and non-interpreters. The interpreters are behaving closer to monolinguals. The group effect did not reach significance when comparing mon to in accross conditions, however it was .057. The non-morphological ending seems to be harder to anticipate for the non-interpreters and, as we saw earlier, they are only anticipating in the CVC-oxytonce condition.

- Stress: oxy fixated earlier than parox
- Syl x stress: coda increases fixations for parox only


**NIN**

- Stress x coda: adding a coda improves prediction, but only in paroxytones

**IN**
- Anticipate later than MO
- Anticipate later than NIN, but at a faster rate

### Experiment 2 papa-papá

**MON**

**NIN**
- Anticipate less than MON
- Anticipate later than MON (but faster)

**IN**
- Interaction is stronger (coda more helpful)
- Anticipate earlier than NIN

I started by a descriptive explanation of what's going on, here is a summary of the effects and interactions that we got from the growth curve analysis.

# Discussion

- Monolinguals use stress and syllabic structure in a similar way for predicting both morphological and non-morphological word endings 

- Experience with interpreting doesn't seem to have a big impact on the prediction of morphology

- But it does make a difference when predicting non-morphological endings

- Both lexical stress and syllabic structure behave in the same direction
    - Less frequent cond (oxytone, CVC) improve prediction
    - Having fewer lexical competitors accelarates prediction


---

# Conclusions

1. Our findings support models advocating that it is possible to train anticipatory processing <sup>(Schremm, et al., 2017)</sup>, also with long-term training.

2. Prediction strategies in the bilingual mind can be enhanced through implicit (i.e. interpreting) training. 

3. Prediction strategies are qualitatively similar in the L1 and L2, but quantitatively different.



---

# Limitations and future studies

- Other reasons why interpreters are better:
    - increased weekly contact with the L2, 
    - stronger resistance to articulatory suppression

--

- Semantic relatedness:
    - firma-firmó = verb + semantically related
    - papa-papá = noun + semantically unrelated

--

- Future studies:
    - dedo-dedal = noun + semantically related
    - Is the difference due to a change in grammar category? or semantic relatedness?
